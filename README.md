This is an older version of the code. I plan to improve and refactor it when I have more time to work on it.

The current setup is built for Arabic, with simple responses stored in a JSON file. You can open the file to see how it's structured. If you’d like to adapt it for English, you can simply modify or replace the JSON file with English responses.

As for the model_code.py file — it’s not required to run the chatbot. It’s included for those who are curious about how the model was trained or want to understand the architecture behind it.
